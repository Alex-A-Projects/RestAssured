## üìñ Overview  

This project was created as part of my **learning journey from Pavan‚Äôs RestAssured tutorial series**.  
It demonstrates how to build a robust, modular **API Automation Framework** using **Java**, **TestNG**, and **RestAssured**, following professional QA best practices.  

The goal was to understand end-to-end API automation ‚Äî from test design and data-driven testing to execution and reporting.
